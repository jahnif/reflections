What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates a hidden .git folder where the repository was initialized. It essentially acts as an empty holding pen until files are added to it. It's necessary because all other steps require a repository for further action. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area acts like a working rough draft, allowing you to mold and shape your eventual commit before actually submitting it. If it didn't exist, you'd have to make fewer commits or commit every little change, and the log wouldn't have logical break points for each commit.

change?
